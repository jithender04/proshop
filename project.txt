changing the browser URL, modifying the browser history, and keeping the 
UI state in sync.
React is a popular library for building SPAs. However, as React focuses
only on building user interfaces, it doesnâ€™t have a built-in solution for
routing.React Router is the most popular routing library for React. 
It allows you define routes in the same declarative style:

# Frontend or client side
    using react library
    in App.js
        header which is the navbar contains different links like login,
        cart functionalities.

    ,orders etc. we use mongoose which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM)
    library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between
    data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between 
    objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
